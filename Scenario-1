1)	By using CodePipeline we can achieve automatic build trigger, whenever there is a code change. While configuring CodePipeline, in Source stage select GitHub Webhooks option and branch as master. It will automatically start the pipeline when a change occurs in master branch.

2)	To achieve this scenario, we should ensure that our test execution returns a non-zero exit code on failure because CodeBuild detects build failures by exit codes. We can also use built-in environment variable CODEBUILD_BUILD_SUCCEEDING to show if build is going well. we can use the variable CODEBUILD_BUILD_SUCCEEDING in the post_build section of the buildspec.yml file in CodeBuild. If the value of this env variable is 1 then build is passed and if it is 0 it’s failed and show Build is not successful.

3)	We can use AWS CodeDeploy to create an app and Deployment group by giving all the details of Dev environment. Then in AWS CodePipeline configuration, in deploy stage we can choose AWS CodeDeploy as Deploy provider and we have to provide application name and deployment group details. It will automatically deploy artifact to Dev environment.

4)	Under CodeBuild, we can create CodeBuild projects each stage. As we have created for Dev, we have to only for QA and Prod environments. These pipelines run sequentially, meaning that it’s an ordered set of steps to deploy the code between stages. In QA and Prod, the approvers are notified that the build process has started so they can perform approval process.

5)	In AWS CodePipeline, we can add an approval action to a stage in a pipeline at the point where we want the pipeline execution to stop so that someone with the required AWS Identity and Access Management permissions can approve or reject the action. We can configure this approval action to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic when the pipeline stops at the action. Amazon SNS delivers the message to every endpoint subscribed to the topic. The approvers IAM user or approvers group should have AWSCodePipelineApproverAccess managed policy attached to it. We can add this approval actions before QA and Prod deployment.
